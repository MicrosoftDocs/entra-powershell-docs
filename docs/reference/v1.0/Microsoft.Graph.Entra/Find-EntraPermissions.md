# Find-EntraPermissions

## SYNOPSIS

The Microsoft Entra PowerShell SDK application requires users to have domain knowledge of both the semantics and
syntax of Microsoft Entra API permissions used to authorize access to the API. This cmdlet helps to answer the
following questions:  - How do I find the values to supply to the permission-related parameters of commands like
New-EntraApplication and other application and consent related commands? - What permissions are applicable to a
certain domain, for example, application, directory? To use Microsoft Entra PowerShell SDK to access Microsoft
Entra ID, users must sign in to a Microsoft Entra ID application using the Connect-Entra command. Use the
Find-EntraCommand to find which permissions to use for a specific cmdlet or API.-  Currently PowerShell commands
and scripts, including those implemented with Microsoft Entra PowerShell SDK itself, have no way of validating
user input that refers to permissions or providing "auto-complete" user experiences to help users accurately
supply input to commands

## SYNTAX


### Add Entra Environment Name

```powershell
Find-EntraPermissions 
    [-SearchString] <String>
    [-ExactMatch]
    [-PermissionType <String>]
    [-Online]
    [-ProgressAction <ActionPreference>]
    [<CommonParameters>]
```
